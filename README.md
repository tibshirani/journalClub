# journalClub-2025


This repository is for Stats 319 Winter 2024-2025 . Wednesdays 1:30-2:50

There is a folder for each paper, containing a README.md, a pdf of the paper and a summary of the paper (thanks to chatgp3) in
the Description file
#
Each student is expected to choose a paper, and present it to the class. The writeup should be deposited in the paper's folder.
The README.md file should contain a high level explanation of the paper, suitable for an undergrad who is trying to choose a major.
After the course is over, we will direct undergrads to this repo, to try to encourage them to major in Statistics or enter a  masters or PhD. program in Statistics.

#
Other students can/should upload  any comments they have about the presentation or the README.md
#
For the presentation, it would be good to  give some background on the authors, and discuss software that implements the given methodology (if appropriate)
#
Also: what important work preceded the given work, and what were notable developments since then?
